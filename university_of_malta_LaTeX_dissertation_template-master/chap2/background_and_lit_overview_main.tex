\chapter{Background \& Literature Overview}

In December 2020 the European Commission published a survey titled: Public Opinion on Covid-19 Vaccination in the European Union 2020~\citep{eupublicopinion}.
In this survey, a total of 24,424 interviews where conducted in over 27 European countries to see the public's views on:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Attitudes to vaccination.
  \item General satisfaction with EU measures to fight the pandemic.
  \item Information on Covid-19.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent The data collected was done manually via either online forms or telephone calls and was represented visually in the published survey.
Similar in scope to this \ac{IAPT}, \citet{ztrk2018} performed an extensive sentiment analysis using related Turkish and English tweets on the Syrian refugee crisis.

For a proper analyses of online european content, a varied dataset is collected.
Two general sets of sources, social media platforms and online newspapers are identified as sufficient and adequate for this \ac{IAPT}.

\subsection{Social Media Platform Data Collection}
\index{Data Collection!Social Media Platform Data Collection}

Social media platform data collection can be done via several methods.
Most platforms offer official \ac{REST} \ac{API}, while for others a traditional web-scraping techniques are used to collect the data.
In 2016 Twitter users posted an average of 500 million tweets, daily~\citep{Crannell2016}.
In the same year, the number of active Twitter users exceeded 22\% of the internet users in the world~\citep{Kayser2016}.
This amounted to 342 million daily active users at the time.
More recently this figure has changed to 330 million daily users ~\citep{tankovska_2021}.

Another popular social media platform is Facebook.
In the case of Malta 92.3\% of the population ~\citep{napoleoncat} is an active user of the platform.
The possibility of using Facebook as a data source was explored where Covid-19 related influencers, social leaders and local media pages' posts would be collected as well as their audience user engagement, .i.e comments and shares.
However the \ac{API} was found to not be as accessible or usable as the Twitter \ac{API}.
Due to its global reach and usable \ac{API} it was decided that Twitter would be the social media platform from which public opinionated data will be collected.

\subsection{Newspaper Article Data Collection}
\index{Data Collection!Newspaper Article Data Collection}

Unlike social media platforms the more traditional newspapers, sometimes referred to as the fourth estate, are decentralised and not limited to one platform.
In fact many modern newspapers utilize social media to share and advertise on.
During the research done for this \ac{IAPT} it was found that most published works that use an article headline dataset, have this dataset collected manually such as in \citet{newspaper_headlines}.
However a number of online \ac{API}s where found and tested with the intention of collecting a dataset spanning 6 months.
These \ac{API}s were newsapi~\citep{newsapi}) and newscatcher~\citep{newscatcher}, notwithstanding their topic and country search functionality, accessing articles past one month was a paid feature.
So it was decided to not use these \ac{API}s due to budgeting reasons.
It was then decided that the article heading dataset would be collected and validated manually.

\section{Data Processing}
\index{Data Processing|(}

Europe is a diverse continent full of different peoples, cultures and languages.
To match data with an origin country two methods where used.
Either the data came with a geo-tag, .i.e the origin country was specified somewhere with the text of the data.
Or the source language was used.
Due to a number of different languages collected the decision had to be taken whether to implement a multi-lingual \ac{SA} model or use machine translation.
\citet{Balahur2014} state that commercial engines are able to translate from and into a large number of languages.
\citet{Arajo2020} use and experiment number commercially available machine translation engines, produced the table~\ref{tab:translators}.
From table~\ref{tab:translators} the Google and Yandex \ac{API}s where checked due to them achieving the highest Macro-F1 score.
Between the two the Google Cloud Translation \ac{API} was cheapest.

\section{Sentiment Analyses}
\index{Sentiment Analyses|(}

As an active research field that has emerged recently, \ac{SA} is a discipline that extracts people’s feelings, opinions, thoughts and behaviors from user’s text data using \ac{NLP} methods~\citep{danneman2014social}.
Moreover, sentiment analysis is also known as opinion mining, with emphasis on text classification problem.
Extracting sentiment information from web-scale text data can be very challenging and expensive task due to large amount of data~\citep{FernndezGavilanes2016}.
A survey conducted by \citet{Lo2016} explores two main approaches for \ac{SA}, subjectivity and polarity detection.
There subjectivity detection described as an understanding on whether the content contains personal views and opinions as opposed to factual information.
And polarity detection as the study of subjectivity with different polarities, intensities or rankings.
In the context of this \ac{IAPT} polarity detection makes more sense than subjectivity detection.
A frequently used and readily accessible \ac{SA} model is \ac{VADER}.
