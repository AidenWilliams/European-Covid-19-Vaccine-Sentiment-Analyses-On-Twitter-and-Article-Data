\chapter{Background \& Literature Overview}

In December 2020 the European Commission published a survey titled: Public Opinion on Covid-19 Vaccination in the European Union 2020~\citep{eupublicopinion}.
In this survey, a total of 24,424 interviews where conducted in over 27 European countries to see the public's views on:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Attitudes to vaccination.
  \item General satisfaction with EU measures to fight the pandemic.
  \item Information on Covid-19.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent The data collected was done manually via either online forms or telephone calls and was represented visually in the published survey.
Similar in scope to this \ac{IAPT}, \citet{ztrk2018} performed an extensive sentiment analysis using related Turkish and English tweets on the Syrian refugee crisis.

%A large dataset of Twitter statuses available online, is maintained by Panacea Lab~\citep{banda2020largescale}.
%This dataset spans a range between January 2020 till now, June 2021 as it is updated every two weeks.
%On average there are 4 million tweets written in various languages.
%For analyses and getting the \ac{SA} scores the \ac{VADER} model is commonly used.

\section{Data Collection}
\index{Data Collection|(}

For a proper analyses of online european content, a varied dataset is collected.
Two general sets of sources, social media platforms and online newspapers are identified as sufficient and adequate for this \ac{IAPT}.

\subsection{Social Media Platform Data Collection}
\index{Data Collection!Social Media Platform Data Collection}

Social media platform data collection can be done via several methods.
Most platforms offer official \ac{REST} \ac{API}, while for others traditional web-scraping techniques are used to collect the data.
In 2016 Twitter users posted an average of 500 million tweets, daily~\citep{Crannell2016}.
In the same year, the number of active Twitter users exceeded 22\% of the internet users in the world~\citep{Kayser2016}.
This amounted to 342 million daily active users at the time.
More recently this figure has changed to 330 million daily users ~\citep{tankovska_2021}.

Due to its global reach and usable \ac{API} it was decided that Twitter would be the social media platform from which public opinionated data will be collected.
