    abstract = {The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has attracted the world’s attention because of its spread in Iraq and Syria and its brutal treatment of people. At this point, there is no enough research about if people in both the Western and Eastern countries view ISIS as a terrorist organization and a source of fear or they view it differently. Recently, social media has become important for social networking and content sharing. Twitter is a microblogging website that allows users to share short text messages, also known as tweets, with up to 140 characters. This research uses twitter to conduct text mining and sentiment analysis to examine if there is a difference between people from the Western countries and the Eastern countries on how they view ISIS. To accomplish this goal, Twitter’s API was used to search and collect tweets about ISIS from eight different countries. Moreover, term frequency- inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) technique was used to conduct the text sentiment analysis using R. The results of the sentiment analysis of the tweets indicated that: (1) the people used almost the same words when they are tweeting about ISIS, (2) sharing the same positive and negative words reflects how people think about this organization as a group of terrorists regardless the country they are from and (3) most users view ISIS as a source of threat and fear regardless where they are from.}

As a proxy for sentiment, we use the fraction of positive and negative words in two columns of financial news from the New York Times. The main contribution of the paper is to show that, controlling for other well-known time-series patterns, the predictability of stock returns using news' content is concentrated in recessions. A one standard deviation shock to our news measure during recessions predicts a change in the conditional average return on the DJIA of 12 basis points over one day.},

Their importance becomes more crucial and indispensable in the times of health crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Since the starting of this pandemic newspapers are providing rich information to the public about various issues such as the discovery of a new strain of coronavirus, lockdown and other restrictions, government policies, and information related to the vaccine development for the same. In this scenario, analysis of emergent and widely reported topics/themes/issues and associated sentiments from various countries can help us better understand the COVID-19 pandemic. In our research, the database of more than 100,000 COVID-19 news headlines and articles were analyzed using top2vec (for topic modeling) and RoBERTa (for sentiment classification and analysis). Our topic modeling results highlighted that education, economy, US, and sports are some of the most common and widely reported themes across UK, India, Japan, South Korea. Further, our sentiment classification model achieved 90% validation accuracy and the analysis showed that the worst affected country, i.e. the UK (in our dataset) also has the highest percentage of negative sentiment.},
