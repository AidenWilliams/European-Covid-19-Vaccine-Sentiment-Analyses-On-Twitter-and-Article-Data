    abstract={Opinion Mining also known as Sentiment Analysis, is a technique or procedure which uses Natural Language processing (NLP) to classify the outcome from text. There are various NLP tools available which are used for processing text data. Multiple research have been done in opinion mining for online blogs, Twitter, Facebook etc. This paper proposes a new opinion mining technique using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and NLP tools on newspaper headlines. Relative words are generated using Stanford CoreNLP, which is passed to SVM using count vectorizer. On comparing three models using confusion matrix, results indicate that Tf-idf and Linear SVM provides better accuracy for smaller dataset. While for larger dataset, SGD and linear SVM model outperform other models.},
